Imagine a world where there are no gender markings! No stereotypes ! No boys having to wear blue and girls draping themselves in pink! No aggressive boys and girls being demure! No rules like ?boys don?t cry? and ?boys will be boys.?
If only girls could have managed to do everything that boys have got to do for centuries. It?s a little hard to imagine such a scenario given that we are the product of a culture that has always reiterated gender stereotypes.
However, we can?t be accused of not trying. Women for centuries have tried to shed the noose of norms, of stereotypes, and of gender roles as role models, as leaders, as feminists, and as artists. Today we look at women who are not real but somehow mirror many of us who have broken the rules and set ourselves free from the noose of gender stereotypes .

Elizabeth Bennet
When she was supposed to be simpering behind her fan before the gentlemen, practising the piano, and learning how to knit, paint, dance, and settle into a marriage of convenience with a suitor of her father?s choosing, Elizabeth Bennet chose love.

One of the most intriguing and unconventional characters from British classics, Elizabeth Bennet is one of the most admired and loved characters of Jane Austen?s work Pride and Prejudice .
Elizabeth stood against everything the British gentry sought to call and set as the norm. She broke the stereotype of how women were supposed to behave. She spoke her mind; she spoke from the heart and refused to give in to a marriage of convenience, much to her mother?s agony.
In the day and age in which the novel is set, saying no to a suitor was almost suicidal, and yet Elizabeth, who did not come from a rich family, rejected a proposal.
It is no wonder then that women across generations have admired Elizabeth, or Lizzy, as her family fondly called to her. She stood up for what she believed in and wanted. She did not allow herself to be boxed into stereotypes or pushed into behaving the way she was expected to.
Jane Eyre
A young orphaned girl working as a governess in a manor with little exposure to the outside world would usually be a meek and submissive young woman given to following commands from superiors.
Nothing of the sort in the case of Jane; she may have been simple and had little exposure to the world, but she is one of the strongest literary characters ever created. Charlotte Bronte?s Jane Eyre is about strength of character, the power of love, and the importance of self-respect.

Jane is again the antithesis of how women were supposed to behave, think, and act. Finding out at the altar that the love of her life was already married, she left him. She stayed away, built a new life for herself, and refused a marriage proposal, but eventually took care of him when he had lost everything. She met him on her own terms.
Jane showed great courage even when she was heartbroken, and always maintained her dignity and self-respect in trying to move on with life. Jane?s story is unusual for her time, for women of her generation would have not done any of the things she did.
Scarlett O?Hara
The heroine of Margaret Mitchell?s Gone with the Wind, Scarlett O?Hara of Tara may just about fool you into believing that she, like other women of generation, had only two concerns ? clothes and men. The latter she never had a dearth of; with a string of young men falling over her, Scarlett was often the beneficiary of male attention.
She was shrewd, and with guile and display of feminine charms, knew how to wrap men around her little finger. But in the midst of a world marred by war, this woman, so often described as self-obsessed, managed to display her strength of character.

Scarlett never gave up; she was a fighter ? be it for misplaced love, money, for her home and heritage, or for the people who were dependent on her.
Always at the centre of controversies, she never wavered from her intentions. She couldn?t care less about what others thought of her or the number of rules she broke.

She was who she was without any qualms. That is this character?s beauty for it inspires you to be you, without being embarrassed about it.
Jo March
Louisa May Alcott?s novel Little Women is a much-loved work revolving around the lives of four sisters, each with a unique identity. However, the most loved one is the eldest sister, Jo.
(image credit ? bookriot ) Winona Ryder as Jo March
Partly based on the author herself, Jo was tomboy who was rebellious, strong-minded, independent, and outspoken. Jo was a very unusual character for her generation, but those very qualities make her so endearing.
As the eldest sibling she displayed an inspiring integrity . Her strong sense of responsibility towards her family made her so loveable.
Anna Karenina
In Leo Tolstoy?s eponymous masterpiece, Anna Karenina is a strong, wilful, and proud Russian aristocrat. A married woman, she has an affair and is disgraced by society and yet does not shy away from facing her fellow aristocrats from St. Petersburg. She faces a society that has dual standards towards men who indulge in adultery and are not questioned but Anna is sentenced to social exile.
(image credit ? creativecow.net ) Keira Knighltley as Anna Karenina
She is well read and intelligent, also spirited and passionate. Tolstoy beautifully captures the duality of the Russian aristocracy towards men and women in the context of philandering and adultery. Anna is driven by love, and follows her heart. It is one of the strongest traits of her character ? to follow her heart. It is what she inspires the readers to do.
Each of these women is a strong reminder of the shackles that women need to break, rules that they need to bend, and the dreams that they need to follow. Stereotypes will have to be broken, one woman at a time.

"2","https://yourstory.com/2016/08/share-at-door-step/","This entrepreneur is making giving back to society a little easier with her social venture","How many times have you thrown away something that was fully functional, just because it was a little old for your taste or because it was of no use to you anymore?
The answer is probably ?several times?.
From toys to old gadgets to furniture, we have given them away at throwaway prices at junkyard shops or left them unused to gather dust in some corner of the house.? While we knew that some of those things could have helped somebody in need, we didn?t know how to reach them.
Filling in the gap
Anushka Jain, with her venture Share At Door Step (SADS) , aims to address this gap. SADS, a for-profit social venture, provides cause related marketing solutions to companies, supports Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) related activities, and provides doorstep donation services to individuals and corporate donors. Explaining how SADS makes it easy to make non-monetary donations to non-profits, the twenty seven-year-old says, ?Users have to just visit the SADS website and select their location, after which they will be presented with information on the requirements of the non-profits that are SADS? partners. Once the users find a match, they can schedule a pickup. Users can also opt for the ?SADS fulfilled? option, where we take care of delivering the donation items to the right non-profit.?

And each time donors donate, they receive gifts from a socially inclined brand as a gesture of gratitude. On one hand, this motivates donors, and on the other, it enables a brand to build, strengthen and connect with their target audience.

The beginning
?So what prompted you to start SADS?? we ask.
I grew up watching my mother donate clothes and toys to non-profits on my birthday. When I pondered upon why my mother did this only once a year, I realised there was no easy way to make non-monetary donations. You had to do it yourself, which is time and energy consuming.
While this was the tipping point, Anushka has always been a self-proclaimed go-getter. She says, ?Foraying into entrepreneurship was a choice. Growing up in a middle-class family, my parents expected me to get employed in a corporate after finishing my higher education, then to get married and live happily ever after ? like an Indian soap opera. But I was tinkering with ideas.?
Anushka says that as she grew up and learnt about the real challenges of setting up a business, those ideas took more concrete shape. With a chuckle, she says, ?While I was busy checking out profiles of potential business partners and meeting them, my parents were stalking profiles of guys on various matrimony sites.? She adds, ?The term entrepreneurship is fairly new to my family. It was difficult to convince my parents that following your dreams and starting a social venture was better than just what is generally paraphrased as ?settling down in life?.? Anushka is confident that it is just a matter of time before she can convince her parents to support her startup ambitions.

Hands on experience
Inspired by the story of the founders of Flipkart , Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, who would go out on a scooter for book deliveries around Bengaluru in the initial days after Flipkart began its operations, Anushka too followed the same route. She did the first 150 pickup for SADS herself. She says, ?This helped to understand the nuances of the business and also provided valuable insights to make course corrections and take SADS ahead.?
Responding to the question of whether she faced any challenges doing these 150 pickups, she says, ?Most often, I was greeted with a surprised look when people opened their doors. They never expected a girl to do the pickups. Most of them were appreciative of my effort. However, that said, personal security is a challenge, occupational or otherwise.?
SADS has worked with a number of corporates, partnering with more than 25 trusted non-profits such as Aide Et Action and Mobility India, among others. Anushka says ,
Since our first pickup in 2012, we have impacted 1 lakh people, through contributions from 30,000 households.
One of their most successful campaigns, aimed at driving publicity for SADS while simultaneously motivating people, especially the younger lot, to give back, saw people giving away even expensive items such as Ray Bans sunglasses, iPods, laptops and loads of stuffed toys. A pause and a naughty smile later, the founder says the campaign was titled, ?Don?t just dump your Ex, Dump their stuff as well.?
Challenges in a niche market
So what makes SADS different from other players in the market?
Anushka says, ?There are agencies which provide door-to-door collection services. There are those which provide sampling and market research services, but not many who do a good job at providing a full suite of branding, cause marketing, research and sampling services. And we do all of that, really well.?
But in spite of being a niche player, catering to a fairly popular demand, success never came easy. ?As human beings, we are always sceptical about adopting and embracing new platforms, until we see value in them. And that happens gradually. Similar to what e-commerce companies faced a couple of years ago, when people refused to believe in anything beyond shopping in brick and mortar stores. Since SADS is a niche venture, it was difficult to prove its value to the very first donor, non-profit, and corporate. But once they all saw value, there was no looking back. Non-profits have seen a spike in useful non-monetary donations, donors are in love with our idea, and corporates see value in our business proposition.?
Today, the challenge for SADS is more about scaling up and integrating technology in their processes. The founder explains that as they continue to scale up, the demand-supply equation has become more complex, calling for the need to automate various processes. ?Since a large percentage of the non-profits still rely on manual processes for day-to-day functioning, it gets difficult.? SADS is addressing this challenge by training the non-profits with newer technology, which is more accessible and easier to adopt. Anushka says, ?Today, we ask the non-profits to send us the receipts through images on WhatsApp, thus eliminating the need for scanning the receipt and then sending it to us over e-mail. There are a number of examples like this.?

Looking forward
With a revenue model based on B2B partnerships with various brands for cause-related marketing, SADS is targeting expansion in 4-6 cities in the next year. The founder says she is also ?actively looking for strategic partners who can help the venture expand to different geographical parts of the country or bring in the required capital and experience to help the venture achieve the said goal.? In terms of the offering, they plan to start SADS fulfilled donation pickups and express pickups in the next few months, and on the technology side, they are planning to build a better prediction and matching algorithm, thereby making the entire process more efficient and effective. The founder says SADS? revenue has grown over the years and it has moved closer to break even, but refused to divulge the numbers.
? India is a society where ?doing good? in inherent and valued. All we are doing is providing an avenue for people and brands to channelise this positive attribute and thereby give back to society, and that for me is very satisfying,? summarises the young entrepreneur.

Trans women and non-binary femme tech entrepreneurs have a new legal?resource
?What if I figured out a way to take Facebook from 2004 and bring it to 2016? What if every field in your profile was a full video?? asks Facebook?s 19-year-old product prodigy Michael Sayman.
The answer is Lifestage, a standalone iOS app for people 21 and under, which Facebook is launching today. It asks for your happy face, sad face, likes, dislikes, best friend, the way you dance and more, but instead of filling in this biography quiz with text, you shoot videos. Lifestage turns those clips you recorded into a video profile others can watch.
While technically anyone can download Lifestage, anyone 22 or older will only be able to see their own profile. That?s because it?s?built for high-schoolers to learn more about their classmates. A quick swipe lets you block and report people, too, in case anyone sketchy tries to creep on the kids.
When you sign up, with no need for a Facebook account, you select your high school, and will then see the video profiles from people at your school or ones nearby. And for added virality, Lifestage only shows you other people once 20 people from your school are using it. That way, you nag your friends to join. In that way, it mimics the way Facebook was originally launched ? school by school ? because social apps are no fun if you don?t know anyone using them.
App Store Cinderella
Sayman isn?t another 30-year-old product manager from an elite college. His parents from Peru and Bolivia raised him in Miami. There he taught himself to code at age 13 with tutorials he found on Google. His first product, a $1 app with tips for the Club Penguin game, earned thousands of dollars. That money helped his family stay afloat during the recession after their house was foreclosed upon. You can read about his journey in Carmel DeAmicis? profile of Sayman .
Michael Sayman, Facebook product manager and creator of Lifestage
His big break came when he overheard his sister on the phone, sending photos to a friend and trying to make her guess which word they represented. That inspired Sayman to build 4Snaps, a photo-charades app. Thanks to a revenue share partnership with marketer Instafluence, 4Snaps reached No. 1 on the word games chart, with a few million users.
By then the app was overloading the free tier of Parse, the Facebook-owned mobile backend hosting service. Sayman negotiated a massive discount that let him keep operating 4Snaps. But Mark Zuckerberg ended up inviting Sayman to come visit Facebook, create a special presentation for its F8 conference and eventually intern there.
He?s spent the last two years getting acquainted with the social network and coming up with the idea for Lifestage. ?I wanted to work on an app that my demographic would relate to, or at least that my friends would want to use.? Along with?a team of three engineers and one design contractor, Sayman is now ready to ship his brainchild.
Your life on a stage
To build Lifestage, Sayman tells me ?I went back and looked at Facebook from 2004. At the time I was in second grade.? Thanks for making the rest of us feel old, kid. Back then, Facebook opened to your own profile, not the News Feed. Lifestage works similarly. You?ll see a bunch of bio questions you can answer with videos. The more you fill in, the more questions are unlocked.
In the feed you?ll see people from your school who?have recently updated their profiles, which you can tap through to see specific answers, or swipe through to skip to different sections. To instill some gamification, people get ranked with higher levels if they?ve added more to their profile. You?ll also see a sunglasses-smile emoji by people who recently updated, while those who?ve let their profiles languish will show a frown or even the poop emoji.
There?s no way to contact people directly in?Lifestage, since Sayman explains ?my friends and I have a bajillion messaging apps we already use and love, so what?s the point of having another messaging app? It just seems annoying to me.? Instead, each users gets a ?Reach Me? line of text that appears beneath their name, which could be used to show off their Snapchat or Instagram handle, or another piece of contact info.
Lifestage could capture the attention of teens that Facebook fears might slip away to Snapchat. When asked about Snapchat, Sayman said ?I think of it like really great competition. They?ve got?a?great product and there?s a lot to learn?about?how people have started to evolve the video space.? That said, he does note that his Instagram Stories are getting more than his posts on Snapchat.
The worry for Lifestage is that Facebook has a poor track record with standalone apps, having shut down Poke, Slingshot, Paper and Notify. Facebook clearly doesn?t see it derailing Snapchat, because?Lifestage?s promotional materials include Reach Me text like ?Snapchat me.? Oh, and Facebook launched it on a Friday afternoon, the least-read time for blogs. It?s almost like it?s not supposed to succeed on its own.
Instead, Lifestage could teach Facebook how to improve its profiles with video, as?Mark Zuckerberg wants ?video at the heart of all our apps and services.? Facebook launched profile picture videos at F8, but they don?t seem all that popular yet.
Lifestage takes an innovative stance. You could say your dog is your favorite pet, you love Radiohead or that this is who you?re dating. But with videos, those aren?t lines of generic text. They?re totally unique videos that truly tell the story of who you are. That same idea could make Facebook seem fresh, even if it?s almost as old as the kids Lifestage was built for.

SEC looks into Hampton Creek?s mayo buy back?scheme
Every so often, I find myself forced to use the Web on a browser without uBlock or an equivalent; and every time, I think to myself ?How do people live like this?? The un-ad-blocked web is a miserable cesspool of autoplaying video and hysterical calls to action, slow to load, hard to look at. It?s even worse on your phone, where ads devour your battery life and up to 75% of your data .
Apple, to their credit, supports ad blockers for Mobile Safari. But Google? Yeah, not so much. You can run a separate browser, such as Brave . You can run through a proxy, or reset your DNS to use an ad blocker like Optimal . But you can?t just add an ad blocker to Chrome for Android. Surprising that a company with Google?s technical chops hasn?t made that possible yet.
?Or maybe it isn?t so surprising. After all, most of Google?s money comes from display and search ads. Perhaps relatedly, Apple also makes it pretty easy to change DNS settings on iOS: it?s a much bigger pain on Android, whether via the Wi-Fi settings or programmatically .
The fundamental problem is that users hate ads but sites need ad money. The most interesting initiatives in the ad-blocking world are the two I mentioned above, Brave and Optimal, because both are trying to attack this root problem. Brave replaces ?bad ads? with ?good ads? that don?t track or annoy users, with a long-game eye on replacing ad revenue with micropayments. Optimal wants to replace ad revenue with subscription payments shared across all sites that Optimal?s users visit.
Ad blocking have become a big enough deal to have gotten Facebook?s attention: the social giant is now blocking ad blockers , while promising to make the ads their users see nicer. As Josh Constine puts it , ?Facebook thinks if it can make its ads non-interruptive, fast, and secure, people won?t mind.?
Now, this has attracted a lot of amused skepticism:
Shorter Facebook: ""We've decided to win an arms race."" https://t.co/c5KokLqD9b
? ?{@ St. Rev @}? (@St_Rev) August 9, 2016
and indeed an arms race has ensued . But I think Facebook is at least halfway right about this. Today?s ad ecosystem suffers from two fundamental problems:
Ads are bad.
Advertising is terrible.
Bad ads are the ones which drain your battery and data. They are the pop-ups and pop-unders. They are the trackers and supercookies. They are the Outbrain and Taboola clickbait at the bottom of articles published by otherwise respectable media.
We're in a world where social media has more comms-security than your bank, and porn sites have better privacy & integrity than news outlets
? Alec Muffett (@AlecMuffett) August 16, 2016
But even ads which are not bad are still terrible. People who are paid by advertising, one way or another, inevitably wind up rationalizing that ads are somehow good for people, that they like seeing ads as long as they match their demographic and interests, etc etc ad nauseum.
I cannot stress enough that this is not true. People hate ads; it?s just a matter of degree. We hate commercial breaks. We hate display ads. We hate billboards. We live with them, because we have no alternative, but we hate them ? and ad blockers have taught us that online, we do have an alternative. We don?t have to see them at all. Replacing ?bad ads? with ?not so bad ads? does not make the fundamental concept of advertising any more palatable.
There are rare exceptions to this rule, of course. Movie trailers are ads, but we don?t hate them ? quite the contrary. We don?t much hate search ads, because they only appear when we are actively looking for something : this is one major reason that Google is a gigantic money-making machine. Similarly, for the same reason, we don?t hate the ?People who bought this also bought? ads on Amazon.
(Even ads that would otherwise be appealing ? eg Apple?s gorgeous ?Shot on iPhone 6S? posters ? can become hateful; not in and of themselves, but because they?re part of the ever-accumulating background of advertising, the ongoing transactionalization of our entire public sphere. No advertiser has any incentive to cut back, so advertising in toto overwhelms us to the point that we are, on some deep level, numbed and disgusted by it all. Call it a tragedy of the cultural commons. This is what Facebook wants to prevent ? but despite its best intentions, I fear that well has already been poisoned by advertising elsewhere.)
Will eliminating bad online ads cause people to forget that advertising is terrible, and lapse back into our learned helplessness? I hope not. A subscription-based automatic-micropayment solution is a better way, I think, and Brave and Optimal are taking steps in that direction. On one hand, I?m not optimistic that we can get to that better world from the current one any time soon; on the other, though, in the long run, doing things your customers hate is always, ultimately, a bad strategy.
Right now that?s a moot point. In the short term, the important thing is that Apple, Brave, Optimal, Facebook, and many others are hammering home the point that ?bad ads? are becoming less and less acceptable. The online advertising ecosystem is, I hope, heading for a ruinous collapse. Organizations which continue to use bad ads will ultimately suffer for it, and some will die, sooner or later. Let?s hope it?s sooner.

A Drawdown in the War on Drugs
The President?s commuting of sentences and an end of the use of private prisons signal potentially meaningful changes in how the United States handles drug abuse.
By
Jelani Cobb
Credit Illustration by Tom Bachtell
In May, 2011, Attorney General Eric Holder invited several cast members from the HBO series ?The Wire? to Washington, D.C., to help promote a Justice Department initiative called the Drug Endangered Children?s Task Force. ?The Wire,? which aired for five seasons and was acclaimed for its nuanced portrayal of the war on drugs, was a favorite of both Holder and President Obama. Holder jokingly ordered the show?s creators, David Simon and Ed Burns, to produce a sixth season. ?I have a lot of power,? he said. ?The Attorney General?s kind remarks are noted and appreciated,? Simon told a reporter. ?We are prepared to go to work on Season 6 of ?The Wire? if the Department of Justice is equally ready to reconsider and address its continuing prosecution of our misguided, destructive, and dehumanizing drug prohibition.? Fans groaned in despair: the improbable sixth season now seemed to hinge on something even less likely, an end to the war on drugs. But the exchange was significant for reasons beyond its implications for HBO?s programming. Although the catastrophic consequences of that war are widely acknowledged, there is less clarity about what ending it would entail.
The United States has declared war on cancer, on pornography, and on terror, and the lesson to be gleaned from those campaigns is that, unlike most other wars, those declared against common nouns seldom come to a precisely defined conclusion. The wars on cancer and pornography were really instances in which martial language was used to bolster particular policy initiatives by the Administrations that enacted them. The war on drugs has been a multitiered campaign that has enlisted legislation, private-sector initiatives, executive-branch support, and public will. But it actually looks like a war, with military-style armaments, random violence, and significant numbers of people taken prisoner. It has been prosecuted throughout eight Administrations and has had the type of social and cultural impact that few things short of real warfare do. During the Civil War, more than a quarter of a million Southern men died, creating the phenomenon of a vast number of female-headed households throughout the region. Mass incarceration during the war on drugs has produced a similar phenomenon among African-American households.
Two things happened this month that seemed to signal a drawdown. First, the President commuted the sentences of two hundred and fourteen people, mostly nonviolent drug offenders held in federal prisons. This brought the number of commutations issued during his Administration to five hundred and sixty-two, a total higher than that of the previous nine Administrations combined. Then, last week, the Justice Department announced that it would phase out the use of private prisons, whose growth had been fed by the war on drugs. (There are some twenty-two thousand federal inmates housed in private prisons.) The announcement brought about a thirty per cent decline in share prices for Corrections Corp., a prison-facility-operation company. That drop may be a harbinger of changing fortunes in the for-profit prison industry. Hillary Clinton, during the primary campaign, had said that the federal government should move away from private prisons, and, after receiving an eighty-six-hundred-dollar contribution from a private-prison lobby, gave that amount to charity.
The Obama commutations come as part of a larger, more gradual program. In 2009, the Justice Department issued a memorandum to federal prosecutors announcing its intention to ?seek a revision of the law? in order ?to eliminate the disparity? between sentences meted out for crack convictions and those for powder cocaine. Federal guidelines mandated stiffer penalties for possession of crack cocaine, which is more common among black drug users, than for possession of the powdered version, which is more frequently used by whites, and as a result African-Americans were incarcerated in disproportionate numbers. The Fair Sentencing Act, of 2010, reduced the disparity in those numbers from a ratio of a hundred to one to eighteen to one. In 2011, the United States Sentencing Commission, an independent bipartisan agency, voted to apply those standards retroactively, which made the cases of twelve thousand prisoners eligible for review and possible sentence reduction. In theory, this reduced focus on nonviolent drug offenses frees up law enforcement to address the violent crime that has always posed a more serious threat.
The same year, Holder announced a clemency initiative, under which as many as ten thousand sentences could be commuted?nearly five per cent of the prison population. The number commuted by Barack Obama will not approach that; each case requires an exhaustive review and so much paperwork that some four thousand attorneys volunteered to assist inmates with preparing applications. Earlier this month, a Times editorial suggested that the President could deploy a liberal interpretation of the 1984 Sentencing Reform Act, which allows for ?compassionate release,? to expedite the process. The clause is typically invoked in the case of inmates who are elderly or ill, but in April the Sentencing Commission broadened the criteria to allow for the release of inmates for ?extraordinary and compelling? reasons.
There is an additional gesture that the President could make: he could formally declare an end to the war. In 1996, when Bill Clinton announced that ?the era of big government is over,? his words were both aspirational and a reflection of policies favored by Republicans and a growing number of centrist Democrats. There?s an emerging and similarly bipartisan consensus for changing the policies that have led to mass incarceration. For a sitting President to declare a conclusion to the most disastrous domestic policy of our time might, even if premature, perhaps mark at least the beginning of its end.
Last year, the Justice Department reported the first decline in the federal prison population in thirty-three years, and a meaningful, if incremental, change in the way that we approach the problem of drug abuse in the United States. The armchair forecast holds that the President?s legacy will be anchored by his handling of two wars abroad. But history may have equal regard for the means by which he handles the one he inherited at home.? ?

Over the past few months, we?ve seen Donald Trump lower, again and again , the bar for political discourse. All the while, though, he?s been lowering the scientific bar, too. In May, for instance, while speaking to an audience of West Virginia coal miners, Trump complained that regulations designed to protect the ozone layer had compromised the quality of his hair spray. Those regulations, he continued, were misguided, because hair spray is used mainly indoors, and so can have no effect on the atmosphere outside. No wonder Hillary Clinton felt the need to include, in her nomination speech, the phrase ?I believe in science.?
Often, Trump is simply wrong about science, even though he should know better. Just as he was a persistent ?birther? even after the evidence convincingly showed that President Obama was born in the United States, Trump now continues to propagate the notion that vaccines cause autism in spite of convincing and widely cited evidence to the contrary. (As he put it during a Republican debate, last September, ?We?ve had so many instances. . . . A child went to have the vaccine, got very, very sick, and now is autistic.?) In other cases, Trump treats scientific facts the way he treats other facts?he ignores or distorts them whenever it?s convenient. He has denied that climate change is real, calling it pseudoscience and advancing a conspiracy theory that ?the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.? But he has also filed a permit request to build a sea wall around one of his golf courses, in Ireland, in order to protect the property from global warming and its consequences. Which Trump is running for President?
Mike Pence, Trump?s running mate, has a more consistent record on science; unfortunately, it?s consistently bad. Pence is an evangelical Christian who is adamantly opposed to embryonic-stem-cell research; in a conversation with Chris Matthews, in 2009, Pence hedged on whether he believes in evolution. Even when it comes to more secular matters, Pence has made some outrageous claims. In 2001, he published an essay piece on his campaign Web site claiming that smoking doesn?t kill. As if to support that claim, he noted in the same piece that one out of three smokers dies from smoking-related illnesses. Pence seems to think that thirty-three per cent and zero per cent are the same.
As if all this weren?t enough, Trump has argued for downsizing the Department of Education and said that the U.S. invests too much money in K-12 schooling. He has suggested that he might appoint Ben Carson? a young-Earth, anti-evolution creationist ?to advise him on educational reform. He has called the National Institutes of Health ?terrible,? and has said that he would eliminate the E.P.A. In April, the science journal Nature reported that his anti-immigrant tirades could be hindering efforts to recruit good scientists and students to the U.S. The list goes on.
The differences between the candidates and their parties could not be more stark. Hillary Clinton has a long history of supporting scientific research; she has long understood the connections between that research and economic development. She has said that, if elected, she would increase funding for the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. As a senator, in 2001 and 2002, she co-sponsored legislation that would have expanded support for stem-cell research. While she hasn?t gone as far as Bernie Sanders in arguing for a carbon tax, Clinton has spoken out strongly about the need to address climate change. Recently, she announced that she would seek to install half a billion solar panels by 2020, and to shift a?third of America?s electricity production to renewable resources by 2027. Clinton has also endorsed proposals to enhance
STEM
in schools, including new-teacher training. Partly as a response to Sanders?s candidacy, she has even pledged to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for families making an annual salary of less than eighty-five thousand dollars today, and less than a hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars by 2021.
On the level of party platforms, too, the differences are extreme. Perhaps in response to Trump?s candidacy, the 2016 Republican Party platform extends policy proposals that were, in 2012, already anti-science. The platform proposes eliminating the current Administration?s Clean Power Plan; prohibiting the E.P.A. from regulating carbon dioxide; officially declaring that climate change is ?far from this nation?s most pressing national security issue?; and dissenting from international agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.?The platform also claims that it is illegal to contribute to the U.N.?s Framework Convention for Climate Change and its Green Climate Fund because of the Palestinian Authority?s membership in the United Nations. It opposes embryonic-stem-cell research and human cloning for research purposes.
The positions taken by Trump and the Republicans have consequences beyond science itself. Essentially, they are betting that, for a significant portion of the country, empirical reality doesn?t matter; they are also signalling that empirical reasoning won?t be the basis of their public policy. Today, of course, we face global challenges such as climate change, which are more urgent than any we have ever confronted. These challenges require a sober assessment of reality. When science is distorted on the campaign trail, it may produce applause lines. But if those distortions lead to bad public policy, the quality of people?s lives will suffer.

Urjit Patel will succeed Raghuram Rajan

AS MUCH as the financial markets they seek to influence, central banks need the confidence of investors to function. So uncertainty over their leadership and questions about their independence are seldom welcome. On August 20th Narendra Modi, India?s prime minister, belatedly appointed a new head of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), nine weeks after Raghuram Rajan, the respected incumbent, surprised everyone by announcing he wouldn?t stay on the job for a second term (as most of his predecessors had) after his three-year term expires on September 4th.
The new governor is Urjit Patel, a former management consultant and corporate adviser, who has served since 2013 as one of four RBI deputy governors. Mr Patel is thought to be of similar ilk to his current boss. That is reassuring for investors still baffled as to why Mr Rajan, a former IMF chief economist with a good record as head of the RBI, was effectively sacked by Mr Modi.

Mr Patel?s remit at the RBI has been to help shape monetary policy. The newish inflation-targeting framework, which has been successful in stemming rising prices (helped by outside factors such as falling oil prices), is as much his as Mr Rajan?s. So is the incoming arrangement, whereby interest rates will be set by a panel comprising government and RBI appointees rather than the RBI?s boss being in sole charge. Though he lacks the stature of Mr Rajan, which probably helped fend off inevitable calls for lower interest-rates from ministers and industrialists, Mr Patel is seen as just as hawkish as the outgoing governor. His appointment should alleviate fears that Mr Rajan's exit was a ploy by Mr Modi to hobble a fiercely independent central bank.
But the RBI?s remit is far larger than just monetary policy. Most notably, it regulates India?s banks, most of which are publicly owned and struggling with dud loans they extended in a mini credit boom to industry and infrastructure companies five years ago. Mr Rajan had forced the banks to recognise the holes in their balance-sheets, indirectly taking on the tycoons who had benefited from the largesse of compliant bank bosses. Plenty suspect it was that stance (along with a tendency for speaking his mind on politically-sensitive subjects) which led to Mr Rajan?s ousting.
The new man?s take on bank regulation is not known. Beyond the usual waystations for central-bank governors?Yale, Oxford, a period spent at the IMF?Mr Patel has spent some time as an executive at Reliance Industries. The group, headed by Mukesh Ambani, India?s richest man, is active in lots of industries (from petrochemicals to telecoms) where connections to government matter. That will give Mr Patel a different perspective from that of his immediate predecessor, who is returning to his academic perch at the University of Chicago.
Some of the sensible stuff enacted in recent years, such as making it much easier for newcomers to obtain banking licences, will surely stay in place. But whether Mr Patel keeps the same amount of pressure on the banks will be a vital test of the early stages of his three-year mandate. Many hope the new governor will simply be a clone of the incumbent. But that would raise questions as to why Mr Modi didn?t just stick with the original.
